Newsfeed Analysis in Tableau
============================

In this project, I created a Tableau dashboard to visualize a subset of real user-interaction data relating to 365DataScience's Newsfeed service. I used this dashboard to answer several guiding questions and continued my analysis to reveal additional insights and recommendations for improving the overall quality of the feature.
